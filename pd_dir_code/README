   *** README -  pd_dir_code *** 

Acknowledgement - The HTML documentation and almost all of the source code in this repo is  
done by David R. Tribble <david@tribble.com>. 

The material comes from David's site here - 
http://david.tribble.com/text/c0xdir.html

The only code *partly* by me is a small part in the file print_dir.c. That code is based on the code in "Example 1" on David's page above.  


From the introduction of the above document -
  
****************************************************************
 1. Introduction 
****************************************************************

" All hosted ISO C (ISO 9899:1999) implementations support the concept of an I/O stream, also known as a file, i.e., a named collection of characters (bytes) that is accessible via the standard library functions declared in the <stdio.h> header, such as fopen().

The majority of hosted C implementations support the concept of a file system, also known as a structured storage device, containing external files. The majority of hosted C implementations also support the notion of directories containing files and possibly nested subdirectories.

A file system typically represents a set of one or more files, usually arranged in a tree-like hierarchy of directories, subdirectories, and files. Each file corresponds to the ISO C notion of a binary or text I/O stream.

This proposal describes a set of types and functions to be added to the standard C library to provide the means to manipulate directories. These new capabilities are intended to be provided by hosted implementations, and should not be required of free-standing implementations."

David has released both the documentation and the source code to the public domain. 
Very many thanks, David, for doing that and for your excellent work in this area.     

So - "share and enjoy", everyone.......  :)
